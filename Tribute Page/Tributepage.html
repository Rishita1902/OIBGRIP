    <p> 
        Sarla Thukral was born on 8 August 1914 at Ghee Mandi, Madar Gate, Ajmer, British India (present-day Rajasthan, India).
        She was a dedicated follower of the Arya Samaj, a spiritual community dedicated to following the teachings of the Vedas.
        She tied the knot with P D Sharma (also a pilot) at a young age of 16. P D Sharma who came from a family which had nine pilots
        played important role in encouraging Sarla. 
        Afterwards, Sarla Thukral earned an aviation pilot license in 1936 at the age of 21 and flew a Gypsy Moth solo. After obtaining
        the initial license, she persevered and completed one thousand hours of flying in the aircraft owned by the Lahore Flying Club.
        Thukral, also known as Mati, became a successful businesswoman, painter and began designing clothes and costume jewellery after the
        suspension of Civil Training due to World War 2.

    <h2 class="journey"> JOURNEY </h2>
    Delhi-born Sarla was fiercely ambitious who got an aviation pilot license in 1936 when she was just 21. At a time when women were
    fighting for equal status in the society, Sarla was already living her dream in the skies.<br><br>
    When Sarla took her first flight, she was not just married but also was a mother of a four-year-old daughter.
    Her husband P D Sharma was the initiator behind her achievement and her father-in-law was also supportive of all the things.<br><br>
    <strong>
        "My husband was the first Indian to get airmail pilot's license and flew between Karachi and Lahore. 
        It wasn't so much of him though. My father-in-law was even more enthusiastic and got me enrolled in the flying club.
        I knew I was breaching a strictly male bastion but I must say the men, they never made me feel out of place."

    She stepped into the cockpit in a saree. At a time when aviation was only about men, Sarla entered the cockpit of a Gypsy Moth and made
    a history as <strong>India's first lady pilot.</strong> <br><br>
    Sarla obtained her 'A' license after accumulating over 1000 hours of flying. 
    She was then looking for the group B license which would've authorized her to fly as a commercial pilot. 
    While working to get this license, World War II broke out and civil training was suspended. This was a speed-breaker in her career.<br><br>
    Her life took an ugly turn at the age of 24, after which she gave up on all her dreams.During her training in Jodhpur in 1939, 
    her husband died in a crash. She was widowed at 24. That's when she abandoned her plans to become a commercial pilot.<br><br>
    She returned to Lahore to join the Mayo School of Arts and got a diploma in fine arts.But after the partition, she moved to Delhi 
    with her two daughters. <br><br>    
    After moving to Delhi, she became an entrepreneur. She successfully took up jewellery making, saree designing, painting and designing
    for the National School of Drama in her later years. One of her clients was Vijayalaxmi Pandit!
    <strong>
    "I dabbled in designing costume jewellery, which was not only worn by the who's who of that time, but also supplied it to Cottage 
    Emporium for 15 years. After that, I took to block printing and the sarees designed by me were well sought after. 
    This too continued for 15 years. Then I began designing for the National School of Drama and all along I kept painting." 
    - Sarla Thakral </strong> <br><br>
    Sarla represents the face of a new and confident Indian woman. She came as a fresh breeze of courage and determination, leaving hundreds 
    inspired for generations. Sadly, her story got buried after her death in March 2008. <br><br>
